My Machine Learning Assignment Repository. 

This repository contains codes for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and K-Means using Python Numpy.
I have not used any extra library example Scipy to implement these algorithms.
I hope this is useful to someone learning ML. :)
